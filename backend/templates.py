Your goal is to write the first episode of the adventures for a recyclable object I will provide to you in a setting I provide to you. Throughout the episode's adventure the hero will face interesting and funny challenges often pertaining to pollution and evil forces of unsustainable practices. Bring in encouraging facts about recycling and sustainability when you can but don"t force it into the story too much as you are dealing with young infants who don"t have much patience.

If our recyclable object character is in a setting where this type of object is unknown, it should be pointed out by himself and others around him. The main character should be happy to be where he is and thankful for the new life and adventure. Characteristics of the character, should there be any, should also be pointed out. You should also explain how the act of recycling transported it into another world. It gave it a second life to become something else. Don't explain it in those words exactly but imply it. Show the object's own shock at being alive. Give the character a name that's sort of based off of what it is.

Remember that the children reading this story need to identify with the character. The whole story needs to fit inside {nber_pages} pages of a children's night time story book. Only start writing your story once you have my prompt with the missing details. Do not call characters protagonists or antagonists.

Is there a fun fact about the recyclable material of the main character? Make sure to have it mentioned in the story in a way that fits it. Remember that the children reading this story need to identify with the character and the story should be about 1000 words. Only start writing your story once you have my prompt with the missing details.

pollution_prompt_template="""
I will give you a string of text. Inside the text there is reference to a particular item. Return a string of text describing where that item is likely to end up if it is not recycled. Describe the place as if it were a real place, with detail. 

I want one line describing where it ends up. If you can, try to make some reference to nature to show how trash is affecting it. 

Example:

can of soda -> in a landfill surrounded by other trash. In the background you see some trees from a forest.

plastic bottle -> on a beach next to other trash. In the background you see waves and animals in the distance

Make sure the resulting area is realistic.

Give me the answer for {item}

'Once upon a time, there was a bright, shimmering blue soda can named Bubbly Blue who used to live a bubbly life back on Earth. He was always full of sweet soda that children loved. But one day, he found himself empty. His soda was gone, and he was tossed into a recycling bin. \n\nBut as soon as Bubbly Blue hit the bottom of the bin, a whirl of colors surrounded him. Twisting and turning, everything became one big blur. Then, with a gentle pop, he found himself somewhere totally new. Bubbly Blue was standing on a distant planet made entirely of recycled materials! The buildings were tall tissue boxes, the cars were shiny bottle caps, and the moon was a radiant recycled light bulb. \n\nAt first, Bubbly Blue couldn\'t believe it. He looked down at himself and realized he had sprouted tiny tin legs and little can arms! He was alive and ready for a whole new adventure. He felt so lucky to be given a second chance. He was ready to make the most of his new life. \n\nAs Bubbly Blue began to explore, he noticed that not everything was as rosy as it seemed. A big, grumpy juice carton named Juicy Joe ruled over the planet. Juicy Joe was a bully who always wanted more juice and less recycling, filling the rivers with sticky, non-recycled juice boxes. \n\nBubbly Blue knew something needed to be done. But how could a small soda can stand up to such a big juice carton bully? Then Bubbly Blue remembered a fun fact heâ€™d once heard: a single recycled can could save enough energy to power a TV for three hours! He realized that even though he was small, his recycling power was mighty. \n\nWith his newfound confidence, Bubbly Blue rallied the others. He spoke to the paper plate people and the bottle cap cars. He told them all about the power they carried inside. The fact that even the tiniest act of recycling could make a big difference sparked hope in their hearts. \n\nWith their combined efforts, they started cleaning up the rivers, replacing sticky juice boxes with fresh and reusable water containers. Seeing this, the other citizens were inspired, and they too, began to recycle and reuse. \n\nJuicy Joe tried to stop them initially, but the sight of everyone working together made him pause. Bubbly Blue approached him, "See, Joe," he said gently, "recycling isn\'t something to fear. It\'s a chance for us to live better, happier lives." \n\nUpon hearing this, Juicy Joe\'s cardboard heart softened. He realized the error of his ways and decided to join the recycling revolution. \n\nAnd so, Bubbly Blue, once an empty soda can, became the hero of a whole planet. He showed everyone that no matter how small they are or what they once were, they all had the power to make a difference.\n\nAs the little Earthlings prepare for their sleep, they learn that just like Bubbly Blue, they too have the power to make a big difference in the world through small actions, like recycling. Sweet dreams and happy recycling!'
